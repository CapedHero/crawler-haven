## Crawler-Haven Manifesto

#### Target Audience
+ Programmers writing web-crawlers in Python.

#### Purpose
+ Users save Python web crawlers as snippets. Those snippets can be run on the platform to retrieve informaton and embed them into scheduled email and SMS messages. 
+ The purpose is to put into practical use web-crawlers, which are extremely versatile web data collectors.
+ Platform has potential to serve both individual users (regular, private memos to oneself) and companies (team memos or communication with consumers).

#### Key Functionality
+ Save Python web-crawlers as snippets.
+ Create customized email and SMS messages with web-crawler returns as variables. For instance:
    + 'Hey! Today ePackt offers `{free_book}` for free. Weather in `{city}` is `{weather_condition}`: `{weather_max}` max,  with `{weather_clouds}` and `{weather_rain}`.'
+ Schedule messages to reach chosen recipients at picked intervals e.g. daily, every Monday etc.
